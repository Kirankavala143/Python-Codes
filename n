 1. Introduction to Python
Q: Write a program that takes multiline input from the user until an empty line is entered and then prints each line in reverse order.

ðŸ”µ 2. Data Types
Q: Given a string representing a mathematical expression (e.g., "3 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 4"), evaluate the result without using eval().

ðŸ”µ 3. Variables and Constants
Q: Write a program that swaps two variables without using a third variable or arithmetic operations.

ðŸ”µ 4. Type Casting / Type Conversion
Q: Convert a nested list of mixed data types (e.g., ["1", 2.0, "3.5", [4, "5"]]) into a flat list of integers only. Ignore values that cannot be converted.

ðŸ”µ 5. Operators
Q: Without using built-in comparison operators (<, >, ==, etc.), write a function that checks whether two integers are equal.

ðŸ”µ 6. Conditional Statements
Q: Write a program that simulates a basic calculator supporting +, -, *, /, and % operators using if, elif, and else.

ðŸ”µ 7. Loops
Q: Prinwede
ðŸ”µ 8. Pattern Printing

ðŸ”µ 9. Functions
Q: Write a recursive function to convert a decimal number into its binary representation without using built-in functions.

ðŸŸ¡ 10. Data Structures
ðŸ”¹ Lists
Q: Rotate a list k steps to the right in-place (without using extra space).

ðŸ”¹ Tuples
Q: Given a list of tuples, sort them based on the sum of elements in each tuple.

ðŸ”¹ Sets
Q: Write a function to find all elements that appear in at least two out of three given lists.

ðŸ”¹ Dictionaries
Q: Write a program to group anagrams from a list of strings using a dictionary.

ðŸ”¹ List Comprehensions
Q: Write a list comprehension to generate all palindromic numbers between 10 and 200.

ðŸŸ¡ 11. String Manipulation
Q: Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.
